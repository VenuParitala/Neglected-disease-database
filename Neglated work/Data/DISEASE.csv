Rabies,Rabies is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the brain in humans and other mammals,"Fever, fear of water, confusion, exc."
Trachoma,"Trachoma is an infectious disease caused by bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. The infection causes a roughening of the inner surface of the eyelids. This roughening can lead to pain in the eyes, breakdown of the outer surface or cornea of the eyes, and eventual blindness."," Eye pain, blindness"
Yaws,"Yaws is a tropical infection of the skin, bones and joints caused by the spirochete bacterium Treponema pallidum pertenue. The disease begins with a round, hard swelling of the skin","Hard swelling of the skin, ulcer"
Leprosy,"Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. The disease mainly affects the skin, the peripheral nerves, mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract and the eyes. Leprosy is known to occur at all ages ranging from early infancy to very old age.","Growths (nodules) on the skin.
Thick, stiff or dry skin.
Painless ulcers on the soles of feet.
Painless swelling or lumps on the face or earlobes.
Loss of eyebrows or eyelashes."
Chagas disease,"Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a tropical parasitic disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. It is spread mostly by insects known as Triatominae, or ""kissing bugs"". The symptoms change over the course of the infection.","Mild flu-like symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, body aches, and headaches.
Rash.
Loss of appetite.
Diarrhea.
Vomiting."
Human African trypanosomiasis,African trypanosomiasis is transmitted to humans by tsetse fly bites. The tsetse flies are found only in rural Africa.,"fever, headaches, joint pains and itching. Later stages may include behavioural changes, confusion and poor coordination."
Leishmaniases,An infection with leishmania parasites spread by sandflies.,Black fever
Taeniasis and neurocysticercosis,"Infection with T. solium tapeworms can result in human cysticercosis, which can be a very serious disease that can cause seizures and muscle or eye damage. Taenia saginata does not cause cysticercosis in humans.","The larvae (cysticerci) may develop in the muscles, skin, eyes and the central nervous system. When cysts develop in the brain, the condition is referred to as neurocysticercosis. Symptoms include severe headache, blindness, convulsions, and epileptic seizures, and can be fatal."
Dracunculiasis,"Dracunculiasis, also called Guinea-worm disease (GWD), is a parasitic infection by the Guinea worm. A person becomes infected when they drink water that contains water fleas infected with guinea worm larvae.","Slight fever.
Itchy rash.
Nausea.
Vomiting.
Diarrhea.
Dizziness."
Foodborne trematodiases,"Foodborne trematodiases cause 2 million life years lost to disability and death worldwide every year.
People become infected by eating raw fish, crustaceans or vegetables that harbour the parasite larvae.","As foodborne trematodiases tend to be asymptomatic, early or light infections often go unnoticed. On the other hand, severe pain can occur, especially in the abdomen, if a large number of worms is present. Abdominal pain is most frequent in cases of infection by fascioliasis."
Echinococcosis,"Echinococcosis is spread by contact with animal faeces contaminated with tapeworm eggs. Sources include contaminated food, water and animal fur.
Cysts containing tapeworm larvae may grow in the body for years before symptoms appear. When cysts become large, they may cause nausea, weakness, coughing and stomach or chest pain.
Treatment may include surgery, removal of fluid from the cysts and medication.","Cysts containing tapeworm larvae may grow in the body for years before symptoms appear. When cysts become large, they may cause nausea, weakness, coughing and stomach or chest pain.

Lymphatic filariasis,"Lymphatic filariasis is spread by infected mosquitoes. Their bites deposit a parasite that travels to the lymph system.
","Fever.
Inguinal or axillary lymphadenopathy.
Testicular and/or inguinal pain.
Skin exfoliation."
Onchocerciasis,The disease is spread by repeated bites from infected black flies. It's most common in those who live in remote African villages. People who travel and volunteer in these areas are also at risk.,"skin rashes.

bumps under the skin.
loss of skin elasticity, which can make skin appear thin and brittle.
itching of the eyes."
Schistosomiasis,"The parasite can be found in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. The fresh water becomes contaminated from infected animal or human urine or faeces","rash or itchy skin. Fever, chills, cough, and muscle aches can begin within 1-2 months of infection. Most people have no symptoms at this early phase of infection."
Soil-transmitted helminthiases,"These infections are spread through oral or skin contact with contaminated human faeces. They are most common in warm, moist climates with poor sanitation.","Abdominal pain.
Nausea and vomiting.
Diarrhea.
Fatigue.
Confusion.
Malnutrition."
Mycetoma,"Mycetoma is a chronic, progressively destructive morbid inflammatory disease usually of the foot but any part of the body can be affected. Infection is most probably acquired by traumatic inoculation of certain fungi or ?bacteria into the subcutaneous tissue","starts with a painless lump under the skin.
progresses to open infection discharging small 'grains' containing fungal spores.
causes swollen, disfigured body parts – most commonly hands and feet, back, and buttocks."
Fascilolisis,"Fascioliasis is infection with the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica, which is acquired by eating contaminated watercress or other water plants. Flukes are parasitic flatworms that infect various parts of the body (eg, blood vessels, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, liver) depending on the species.","fever, nausea, a swollen liver, skin rashes and extreme abdominal pain.
